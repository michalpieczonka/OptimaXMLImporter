## General info
An application the purpose of which was/is to facilitate the cooperation of the accounting department of medium companies with the Comarch ERP Optima system. 
The application allows, among other things, to add new items to the Comarch Optima system based on data contained in various types of XML files, 
provided and generated by various other sales programs, such as, Subiekt GT and iHurt.
Additionally, based on the data contained in the processed XML file, OptimaXMLImporter allows user to create external receipt documents ("PZ document") in a fully automatic and safe manner. 
All communication with the Comarch ERP Optima program takes place only through the API provided by Comarch, which makes the application fully safe, 
universal and always compliant with the current version of the Comarch ERP Optima program (including all kinds of trade and tax regulations in Poland).
All communication with the Comarch Optima API takes place through an additional library written in C # (due to the need to use "COM" type objects), 
with which the program communicates using the JACOB (Java-COM bridge) library.
